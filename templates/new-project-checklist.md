# New project checklist (dotfiles mirror)

The authoritative version of this checklist lives in the Obsidian vault
at `Research/Programming/New Project Setup.md`. This copy is mirrored here so the
dotfiles repo stands alone on a machine without the vault checked out.

## At repo creation

- [ ] `git init` (or clone from GitHub if the repo was created on the
      web first).
- [ ] Verify the active git identity:
      ```
      git config user.name        # → Brian Birkinbine
      git config user.email       # → 585281+bbirkinbine@users.noreply.github.com
      ```
      If `user.email` is anything else, fix it before the first commit.
      The global default lives in `~/.gitconfig` (mirrored at
      `~/Downloads/src/dotfiles/.gitconfig`); a wrong value means either
      the global got overridden or a per-repo `.git/config` is shadowing
      it.

### If this is a Python project — use the agentic-workflow scaffolding

- [ ] Run the Python bootstrap:
      ```
      bash ~/Downloads/src/dotfiles/templates/python/bootstrap.sh
      ```
      This drops in CLAUDE.md, WORKFLOW.md, pyproject.toml,
      .pre-commit-config.yaml, the `.claude/` tree (settings.json +
      planner/test-first/reviewer subagents + the slash-command set
      under `.claude/commands/` + the python-module-split /
      python-docstrings / dependency-hygiene skills), and
      `docs/specs/README.md`. Opt-in subagents under
      `.claude/agents/optional/` (security-reviewer,
      performance-reviewer) are not copied — see
      `templates/python/README.md` for when to enable each. Existing
      files are skipped, not overwritten.
- [ ] Read [`templates/python/WORKFLOW.md`](python/WORKFLOW.md) (copied
      into the new project's root as `WORKFLOW.md`) — the human-facing
      loop walkthrough with day-zero setup, per-feature loop, and where
      it goes wrong if you skip steps.
- [ ] Replace every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` in the copied files:
      ```
      rg '\{\{' .
      ```
      No `{{` markers should be left after this pass.
- [ ] Copy [`README.md.template`](README.md.template) → `./README.md`
      and fill in placeholders. The Python bootstrap doesn't copy the
      README because it's the same across all repo flavors. **Do not
      remove the Acknowledgements section** — that's the single
      attribution surface.
- [ ] Install dev environment:
      ```
      uv sync
      uv run pre-commit install
      ```
- [ ] Write your first spec: `docs/specs/0001-<feature>.md`. See
      `docs/specs/README.md` (copied by bootstrap) for the convention.

### If this is a non-Python repo (infra, FPGA, shell, etc.)

- [ ] Copy [`CLAUDE.md.template`](CLAUDE.md.template) → `./CLAUDE.md`,
      fill in placeholders, delete the validation-gates block that
      doesn't apply to this repo's stack.
- [ ] Copy [`README.md.template`](README.md.template) → `./README.md`,
      fill in placeholders. **Do not remove the Acknowledgements
      section** — that's the single attribution surface.

### Both flavors

- [ ] Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT for personal projects unless there's a
      reason otherwise).
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` — start from `~/.gitignore_global` (covered by
      `core.excludesfile`) and add per-language patterns. Whitelist any
      `.env.*.example` files explicitly (`!.env.*.example`).

## On GitHub (after `git push`)

- [ ] Fill in the **About** sidebar — see
      [`github-about.md`](github-about.md). The `ai-assisted` topic tag
      is required; it mirrors the Acknowledgements line in `README.md`.
- [ ] Description sentence in the About sidebar matches the first line of
      `README.md`.
- [ ] Repo visibility is correct (public unless there's a reason).

## First commit hygiene

- [ ] Commit message has no `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.
- [ ] Commit message has no "Generated with Claude Code" footer.
- [ ] Diff has no real secrets, internal hostnames, or work-related
      identifiers.

## When to revisit this checklist

- New machine: re-verify `git config user.email` globally before the first
  commit on that machine.
- New shared/collab repo: identity rules still apply; AI acknowledgement
  may need a collaborator conversation.
- Forking someone else's repo: don't add the AI acknowledgement unless
  you're going to substantially rewrite — small contributions to upstream
  follow upstream's conventions.

## Before flipping a private repo to public

Many of my repos start private and flip to public after the first
feature lands. The flip is irreversible in practice — rewriting history
after the fact changes every commit SHA, breaks existing clones, and the
old state may already be archived by forks, GitHub's network view, or
anyone who pulled before the rewrite. **Pre-flip scrubbing is cheap;
post-flip scrubbing is expensive and incomplete.**

The right habit is to treat the repo as public from commit #1 so this
checklist is just a final verification. If lax habits crept in during
the private phase, this is the moment to catch and fix them.

- [ ] **Author/committer emails across all branches.**
      ```
      git log --all --pretty=fuller | grep -E 'Author|Commit' | sort -u
      ```
      Every line should show the GitHub noreply address. Any other
      address (personal email, work email, an unconfigured `@local`)
      means stop — decide whether to rewrite history with
      `git filter-repo` or accept the leak.
- [ ] **Commit message audit.**
      ```
      git log --all --oneline
      git log --all --pretty=full | less
      ```
      Read every subject and body. Look for: coworker names, manager
      names, customer names, employer references, private ticket IDs
      (`PROJ-1234`, `ENG-456`), internal URLs, embarrassments.
- [ ] **Branch and tag names.**
      ```
      git branch -a
      git tag --list
      ```
      Branch named after an internal Jira ticket? Tag with an
      employer-name prefix? Rename now (`git branch -m`, `git tag <new>
      <old> && git tag -d <old>`).
- [ ] **Secret sweep across history.**
      ```
      git log --all -p | rg -i 'api[_-]?key|secret|token|password|bearer|aws_|sk-|ghp_|xox[bp]-'
      ```
      Anything that looks like a live credential gets rotated *and*
      removed from history. If you have `gitleaks` installed, run it:
      `gitleaks detect --no-banner` (and `gitleaks detect --log-opts="--all"`
      to scan history).
- [ ] **`.env*` and config files.**
      ```
      find . -name '.env*' -not -name '*.example' -not -path './.git/*'
      git ls-files | rg '\.env'
      ```
      Confirm no real env files are tracked. If one is, remove with
      `git rm --cached` and rotate everything it referenced.
- [ ] **Internal-hostname / employer / coworker sweep.**
      ```
      git log --all -p | rg -i '<employer-name>|<coworker-firstname>|\.internal|\.corp|<internal-domain>'
      ```
      Fill in the patterns from memory — the names of people, employers,
      and internal services you've worked with. Aim for false positives
      over false negatives; it's faster to skim hits than to miss one.
- [ ] **Issues, PRs, Discussions, Wiki on the GitHub side.**
      Flipping public exposes every issue and comment, including ones
      from collaborators. If anyone else has commented, ask them before
      flipping. If issues exist, walk each one and scrub identifying
      details from titles + bodies + comments.
- [ ] **CI workflow logs.** GitHub Actions logs become public when the
      repo does. Either delete old workflow runs (Settings → Actions →
      Caches and artifacts, plus the workflow's "Delete all logs"
      action) or audit them for echoed env vars and paths.
- [ ] **Screenshots, recordings, attached files** in `docs/`, PRs, and
      issue bodies. Crop or blur file pickers, terminal prompts, editor
      title bars. A screenshot of VS Code with `/Users/firstname.lastname/Work/<Employer>/`
      visible in the title bar is a full identity disclosure.
- [ ] **README + CLAUDE.md.** Confirm:
      - README has the AI-assisted Acknowledgements section.
      - CLAUDE.md has the no-coauthor and public-hygiene rules from the
        template.
      - Neither file references private collaborators, employers, or
        internal context that was OK to mention privately.
- [ ] **GitHub "About" sidebar.** Once flipped, fill in description +
      `ai-assisted` topic tag — see [`github-about.md`](github-about.md).

### After flipping

- GitHub's secret scanning runs automatically on public repos and emails
  alerts for known token formats. Treat any alert as a real compromise
  and rotate. Don't dismiss alerts as false positives without checking.
- Branch protection and required reviews aren't applied automatically;
  configure them under Settings → Branches if you want them.
- If anything sensitive slipped through and you discover it later, your
  options are: (1) rewrite history with `git filter-repo` and force-push
  (still leaks to anyone who already cloned, but at least removes from
  HEAD), or (2) rotate the credential and move on. There is no full
  "undo" once the public version has been fetched even once.
