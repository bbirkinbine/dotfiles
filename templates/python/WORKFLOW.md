The scaffolding implements the agentic loop
`Spec → Plan → Test-first → Implement → Verify`. The slash commands and
subagents are checkpoints: the agent stops at each transition and surfaces
output rather than rolling forward. The human is the loop driver.

## Day zero (once per project)

```bash
mkdir ~/Downloads/src/myproj && cd ~/Downloads/src/myproj
git init
bash ~/Downloads/src/dotfiles/templates/python/bootstrap.sh
```

Then, in order:

1. **Walk placeholders.** `rg '\{\{' .` — fill in `CLAUDE.md` and
   `pyproject.toml`. A `CLAUDE.md` that still says `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`
   actively misleads the agent on every turn.
2. **Walk the new-project checklist.** See
   `~/Downloads/src/dotfiles/templates/new-project-checklist.md` — README
   AI acknowledgement line, GitHub About sidebar, identity check. The
   identity check is load-bearing: `git config user.email` is baked into
   the first commit forever, and a wrong value leaks once the repo flips
   public.
3. **Decide opt-in subagents up front, not retroactively.**
   - Network surface, auth, untrusted input, secrets, or external
     deserialization → copy `security-reviewer`.
   - Hot path, async, DB queries on user-sized data, or a latency SLO →
     copy `performance-reviewer`.
   - Add a one-line mention of each enabled subagent to the "Subagents"
     section of `CLAUDE.md` so the agent knows when to route to it.
4. **Install the dev environment.**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```
   Verify the PostToolUse hook works by making a trivial edit; you should
   see `ruff format`, `ruff check`, and `mypy` run.

   `pre-commit install` also activates the `no-commit-to-branch`
   guardrail. The initial scaffolding commit lands on `main` — that is
   the one expected commit there; make it before `pre-commit install`,
   or with `git commit --no-verify`. Every change after that goes on a
   branch.

## Per-feature loop

Each step is a separate turn. The slash commands enforce that — every
subagent stops and surfaces output rather than continuing into the next
phase on its own. You decide whether to advance.

                                       # Five forcing questions. Output goes into the

```

## Where this goes wrong if you skip steps

- **Skipping the spec.** `/plan` becomes guess-the-feature; `/review`
  has no anchor to compare against. The reviewer's first check is "does
  the diff match the spec?" — with no spec, it can't run that check.
- **Implementing on `main`.** Skip the branch step and the whole loop
  runs on `main`. The `no-commit-to-branch` guardrail then blocks the
  commit at the *end* — after the work is done, which is the worst time
  to discover it. Branch right after the spec exists; the SessionStart
  hook warning is the early reminder.
- **Skipping `test-first`.** You'll write the implementation first and
  then "tests" that match what you happened to build, not what the spec
  says. Tautological tests pass everything, including the bugs.
- **Running `/spec → /plan → /test-first → implement` in one shot
  without checkpoints.** The checkpoints exist so a wrong turn at the
  spec doesn't propagate through the plan and tests before you notice.
  Cost of catching it at the spec phase: edit a paragraph. Cost of
  catching it at review: redo the work.
- **Skipping `/review-check` before `/review`.** The reviewer's first
  action is `uv run pytest`; if tests fail, the review is wasted on
  broken code. Run the gate first.
- **Forgetting the opt-in subagent install.** `/security` and
  `/performance` print install instructions and stop if the subagent
  isn't in `.claude/agents/`. The check doesn't run. If you decided at
  day zero that the project warrants the opt-in, install it then —
  don't defer.
- **Fabricating external reference data.** When the spec depends on a
  registry, RFC, vendor table, or any other external authority, the
  values must be either fetched in-session (URL + date pinned above the
  table in code) or declared as empirical / original in the spec's
  `## External references` section. The failure mode is the one the
  spec template warns against: the agent writes the table from
  training, names a source it never fetched, then writes fixtures that
  match its own assumptions. Every test passes and every value is
  wrong, because the round-trip never touched reality. If no source has
  been found, the spec must say so — push back at spec time rather than
  invent provenance later.

## Phase handoff (multi-day features)

Single-session features run the loop end-to-end — the common case the
diagram covers.

For a feature that spans multiple sessions — a real architectural
change, a multi-package refactor, anything where the main session would
end the day past 50% context — running the whole loop in one session
degrades review quality. By the time `/review` fires, the main session
has accumulated spec discussion, plan iteration, test-writing, and
implementation context. That's the U-curve from
`Research/Programming/Agentic Programming/01 Context Management for Coding Agents.md`
in the Obsidian vault.

The discipline: at each phase boundary, append a `## Phase handoff`
section to the spec capturing the current state and entry conditions
for the next phase. Then run `/clear` and resume in a fresh session.
The fresh session re-reads `CLAUDE.md`, the spec (with the handoff
section), and the diff — it has all it needs to pick up where the
previous session left off.

Where the boundaries are worth a `/clear`:

- After `/plan` is reviewed and accepted, before `/test-first`.
- After implementation passes `/review-check`, before `/review`.

Skip the handoff on single-session features — it's overhead the loop
doesn't need until the session itself is the bottleneck.

See `docs/specs/README.md` for the `## Phase handoff` and
`## Implementation Notes` section shapes.

## When NOT to use the full loop

The scaffolding is sized for projects you intend to maintain. For a
throwaway one-off script (a `~/Downloads/scratch/` analysis, a
dead-by-Friday spike), the loop is overhead. Skip `bootstrap.sh`
entirely; just write the code. The judgment has to be honest about
which projects are which — most "throwaways" turn out not to be.

A reasonable middle path for small-but-real projects: bootstrap, write a
one-paragraph spec at `docs/specs/0001-<feature>.md`, skip `/plan` (the
codebase is too small to need it), use `/test-first` and `/review-check`,
skip `/review` if you're the only reviewer. Scale the loop to the work.

## Things that aren't obvious from the docs

- **`CLAUDE.md` is re-read every turn**, not just at session start. Edits
  to it take effect on the next prompt — use this to course-correct
  mid-feature ("add to don't-touch: `src/foo/legacy/`").
- **Subagents don't share memory with the main session.** That's the
  point — the reviewer hasn't seen the implementation reasoning, so it
  reads the code fresh. Don't try to "tell the reviewer" something via
  the main session; put it in the spec.
- **The PostToolUse hook can be loud.** If `ruff format` keeps fighting
  your editor, your editor is configured with different settings. Align
  them — `pyproject.toml` is the source of truth.
- **`docs/specs/` is permanent.** Specs aren't deleted after the feature
  ships — they're the project's design log. Future you, and `/review` on
  the next feature, will read them.
- **The opt-in subagents only invoke when you call them.** They are not
  auto-invoked even after you install them; the slash command is the
  trigger. Treat `/security` and `/performance` as a deliberate gate per
  PR, not a passive background check.
- **CI is the non-skippable gate.** `bootstrap.sh` installs
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — ruff + mypy + pytest on every PR. Local
  hooks and `/review-check` can be bypassed; CI cannot. Red CI means the
  PR is not done, whatever the local gate said.
